# hello-world

Hi fellow humans,

My name is wterboy (were just on a username bases right now to calm down). i am fairly new to coding with some college courses under my belt. i would say im a amateur in JS,PHP,CSS,HTML but i really want to learn machine learning as well.

Buttered toast phenomenon is a real thing too.
